config=Combinator settings
invert-wire=__1__ Invert signals
invert-description=Choose which color input signals to invert (turn positive signals into negative and the other way around). See the mod's full description/readme for more details.

input-merge-first=Merge inputs first
input-merge-first-description=[font=default-bold]Unchecked:[/font] stack calculations will be applied to __1__ and __2__ input signals separately, and results merged in output.\n[font=default-bold]Checked:[/font] input signals of both colors will be merged together before applying stack calculations.

input-wagon-stacks=Wagon stacks
input-wagon-stacks-description=Use train wagon capacity as stack size, and process fluid signals along with solids (regardless of non-item signal setting).\nSend cargo/fluid wagon signals along with item/fluid signals to use the wagon's capacity (multiplied by the wagon's signal amount) for each item as that item's stack size.\nIn this mode, wagon signals are never sent to output.

input-op-multiply=Multiply signals by their stack sizes
input-op-divide-ceil=Divide signals by their stack sizes, rounding the result [font=default-bold]away from zero[/font]
input-op-divide-floor=Divide signals by their stack sizes, rounding the result [font=default-bold]towards zero[/font]
input-op-round=Round signals to the nearest full stack
input-op-ceil=Round signals to the nearest full stack [font=default-bold]away from zero[/font]
input-op-floor=Round signals to the nearest full stack [font=default-bold]towards zero[/font]
signal-overflow-status=Signal capacity exceeded [img=info]
signal-overflow-message=Stack combinator is receiving more signals than it can output ([font=default-bold]__1__[/font] vs [font=default-bold]__2__[/font]). Increase the signal capacity in mod startup settings or reduce the number of signals.
output-signals-description=Signals generated by the stack combinator.
input-networks=Input circuit networks
input-networks-description=Signals on the stack combinator's input circuit networks.
output-networks=Output circuit networks
output-networks-description=Signals on the stack combinator's output circuit networks, including those sent by other connected entities.
output-network=__1__ Connection
