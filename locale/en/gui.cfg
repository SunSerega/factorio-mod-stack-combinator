config=Combinator settings
invert-wire=__1__ Invert signals
invert-description=Choose which color input signals to invert (turn positive signals into negative and the other way around). See the mod's full description/readme for more details.
input-combine-first=Combine inputs first
input-combine-first-description=[font=default-bold]Unchecked:[/font] stack calculations will be applied to __1__ and __2__ input signals separately, and results combined in output.\n[font=default-bold]Checked:[/font] input signals of both colors will be merged together before applying stack calculations.
input-op-multiply=Multiply signals by their stack sizes
input-op-divide-ceil=Divide signals by their stack sizes, rounding the result [font=default-bold]away from zero[/font]
input-op-divide-floor=Divide signals by their stack sizes, rounding the result [font=default-bold]towards zero[/font]
input-op-round=Round signals to the nearest full stack
input-op-ceil=Round signals to the nearest full stack [font=default-bold]away from zero[/font]
input-op-floor=Round signals to the nearest full stack [font=default-bold]towards zero[/font]
signal-overflow-status=Signal capacity exceeded [img=info]
signal-overflow-message=Stack combinator is receiving more signals than it can output ([font=default-bold]__1__[/font] vs [font=default-bold]__2__[/font]). Increase the signal capacity in mod startup settings or reduce the number of signals.
output-signals-description=Signals generated by the stack combinator.
input-networks=Input circuit networks
input-networks-description=Signals on the stack combinator's input circuit networks.
output-networks=Output circuit networks
output-networks-description=Signals on the stack combinator's output circuit networks, including those sent by other connected entities.
output-network=__1__ Connection
